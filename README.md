## PHP Hosting
It is possible to host the PHP part of the project on your website. To do so, proceed the following steps:

1. Locate a public folder on a website capable of hosting PHP files and with "php_curl" extension enabled.
2. Upload the "queryPlaytime.php" file from the "web" directory to that folder.
3. (Optional, but highly recommended) Create a folder named "WebCache" and give PHP write access to it. (chmod 755 or 777 for Linux)
4. Edit the plugin configuration file and change the "sm_veterans_url" cvar to the address of the newly uploaded PHP file.
